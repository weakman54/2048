A simple clone of 2048 (https://play2048.co), by weakman54. Done in Love2D.

End goal is to use this as a testing ground for runnint the NEAT algorithm, though I did get a bit ahead of myself and added a bunch of QoL features that weren't necessarily needed.

## Running
Needs Love2D to run, I probably won't build this into executables until someone asks for it.

Instructions are ingame, but the most important one is escape/start to go to the main menu (which has further instructions)

There _is_ controller support, but I cba to write those out at the moment. If you really want to play with a controller, there's not that many controls to figure out, so experiment. (tip, the only unintuitive button is "X" to restart)
